;; Use the following command to list batteries and adapters:
;; $ ls -1 /sys/class/power_supply/

;; If an inotify event haven't been reported in this many
;; seconds, manually poll for new values.
;;
;; Needed as a fallback for systems that don't report events
;; on sysfs/procfs.
;;
;; Disable polling by setting the interval to 0.
