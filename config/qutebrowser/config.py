# Backend to use to display websites. qutebrowser supports two different
# web rendering engines / backends, QtWebKit and QtWebEngine. QtWebKit
# was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6, but picked up as a
# well maintained fork: https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki -
# qutebrowser only supports the fork. QtWebEngine is Qt's official
# successor to QtWebKit. It's slightly more resource hungry than
# QtWebKit and has a couple of missing features in qutebrowser, but is
# generally the preferred choice.

#   - webengine: Use QtWebEngine (based on Chromium).
#   - webkit: Use QtWebKit (based on WebKit, similar to Safari).
